# MiniSavestates

This build is an emergency build to test the differences between public-test version and released version. It is for testing only. I will not be responsible for any special circumstances such as archive corruption. Before enabling related functions, please back up the original `Aseembly-CSharp.dll` and archive saves yourself.

After testing by a of friends from the speedrunning community, it can run on the public beta version.

## How to use

The keybinds are customizable in `<saves location>/minisavestates.json` and by default it is
```json
{
    "LoadStateButton": "f1",
    "SaveStateButton": "f2"
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Multi-save point archiving is not supported now.
